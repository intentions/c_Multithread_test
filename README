This is a test of multithreaded code in c.

The final product "should be" a program that will count the nubmer
of cores on a computer and then launch threads equal to cores-1.

The threads will run a computationally intensive program (probably factoring or some such).

Present status:
cpu counting is functional
thread generation is working

Need to be done:
Factoring program
Tying number of threads generated to number of cpus
